From past few years we have seen a rapid growth in online/digital transactions.  
But there is an issue in this digital system, the issue is too much reliance on internet.
many transactions get Failed/ Delayed because of poor or no internet connection. 
this os is the main issue we are focusing on,
We introduce to Cross Cash a system that is capable of generating Tokens for paying people with no internet /poor internet. these tokens can be purchased in exchange to Cash.
these tokens can be simply be send to any other user. once you payment us done without internet it may be authenticated using sms or internet later whenever available, thus reducing dependency on internet.
once the money is added into your account you can redeem it at any ATM or kiosk or store it in your account for future use.
Cross Cash would have a limit upto  â‚¹2000 because it would ensure security.
